Hello everyone!!

This is a project where I simulate 2 people playing with a board dice: They need to simulate that they are throwing the board dice and the one that took the biggest number sum a point in his score. The game stops when both people decided to stop the game and the player with a higher score wins

This project was very good for me to train some concepts of Python like functions, object orientation

The project has been developed using python
